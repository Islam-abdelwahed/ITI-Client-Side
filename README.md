## Overview
This repository contains all laboratory exercises completed during the **Client-Side Technologies** course as part of my ITI scholarship. The course focuses on building interactive, responsive web applications using only **pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks or libraries.

The labs follow the official course structure from Day 01 to Day 08, with an additional **Bonus-JS** task. The final project is a full e-commerce website developed progressively starting from Lab 3 (CSS) and enhanced throughout the JavaScript labs.
