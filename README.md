## Overview
This repository contains all laboratory exercises completed during the **Client-Side Technologies** course as part of my ITI scholarship. The course focuses on building interactive, responsive web applications using only **pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks or libraries.

The labs progressively develop front-end skills from basic page structure and styling to advanced DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, dynamic content generation, and finally a complete multi-page e-commerce application with cart and wishlist functionality using `localStorage`.

There are **9 labs** in total, each building on the previous ones.

## Repository Structure
```
Client-Side-Technologies/
├── Lab-01-02/                  # Early JS: windows, timers, forms, login validation, basic array ops
├── Lab-05/                     # Array & string manipulation (distinct, sort, filter, eval, capitalization)
├── Lab-07/                     # Advanced DOM: selection, modification, slideshow, dropdown info, dynamic tables
├── Lab-08-Ecommerce/           # Full e-commerce site: product grid, cart, favorites, localStorage persistence
├── Lab-09-MiniApps/            # Interactive apps: To-Do list, Stopwatch, Random array generator
└── README.md                   # This file
```

Each lab folder contains:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Assets (images, icons, backgrounds)
- A dedicated `README.md` with objectives, key features, code highlights, and screenshots/behavior descriptions

## Key Labs & Skills Demonstrated

| Lab       | Main Topics Covered                                                                 |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lab 1–2   | Pop-up windows, timers (`setInterval`), forms & URL params, basic login validation, student array processing |
| Lab 5     | Array operations (remove duplicates, sort, filter, sum/product with `eval`), string capitalization, longest word |
| Lab 7     | DOM selection (`querySelector`, collections), event listeners, slideshow, dynamic content, searchable/sortable tables |
| Lab 8     | Multi-page responsive e-commerce site, modular ES6 scripts, cart & favorites with `localStorage`, quantity controls, total calculation |
| Lab 9     | Mini interactive apps: To-Do list (add/mark complete), Stopwatch (start/pause/stop/reset), Random array generator |

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and forms
- **CSS3** – Flexbox layouts, responsive design, custom styling, hover effects
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation, events, timers, dynamic rendering, `localStorage`, modules
- No external libraries or frameworks

## How to Run
All labs are fully client-side and require **no server**.

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to any lab folder
3. Open the main HTML file (e.g., `list.html` for Lab 8, `todo.html` for Lab 9) in any modern browser
4. Interact directly — all functionality works immediately

## Final Project (Lab 8)
A complete **static e-commerce website** featuring:
- Responsive product grid with hover effects
- Add to Cart & Add to Favorites buttons
- Persistent shopping cart with quantity controls, removal, and real-time total
- Persistent wishlist with clear all functionality
- Shared navigation header and footer across pages
- Clean, modern UI with custom backgrounds and card designs
- WhatsApp ordering integration
